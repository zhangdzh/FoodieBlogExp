  <p>I care about food. I’m what people can call a FOODIE. I am usually picky with food, however I am open-minded to trying new things. I have an abundant amount of knowledge regarding food and I normally watch 2 hours of Youtube videos that relate to food.</p>

  <p>Some of my favorite food-related Youtube channels include Food Insider, Munchies, Bon Appetit, JunsKitchen, and SORTEDfood. I have become an expert on distinguishing foods and I travel just to experience eating new foods. I am a fan of both street food and fine dining. Some places that I would love to travel to eat are Japan, India, and Italy.</p>

  <p>A typical foodie’s day always requires the consumption of delicious food, the wish for a never-ending stomach, and lastly the consequence of more exercise. It is pretty hard to tell a foodie from a typical person. However the main difference would have to be in their choice of foods. Foodies know how to pair the best dishes together. If you are reading this now you better go and find a foodie friend ASAP.</p>

  <p>Now foodie culture is still developing and mainly consists of the younger generation. The older generation have only been reputed as a connoisseur, gastronome, gourmet, and sensualist. However even with as new as foodie culture is currently it is growing quickly as it’s now convenient to travel to new and foreign places to mature your tastebuds.</p>

  <p>To define a foodie more precisely, we are a group that eat food not out of hunger but because it’s our hobby. Now many may question that we’d get fat by eating food as a hobby. However that’s not necessarily the case as some foodies are picky whereas others exercise daily.</p>
